# NewPasswordChecker

To use code, create new project in VS and use C# Console App (.NET Framework). Paste code from Program.cs (Github version) into your Program.cs file within VS. Should run without issues.

This program will let user know if inputted password is secure based on set standards (captial letter included and no special character currently). I admit, poor security practice. This program will be expanded later to account for higher security password testing, but for now I'm experimenting with various C# logic.
